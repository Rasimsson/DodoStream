## Expected behavior

- Be kind and constructive.
- Assume good intent; ask clarifying questions.
- Respect different viewpoints and experiences.

## Unacceptable behavior

- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Threats, doxxing, or sharing private information.
- Deliberate disruption of discussions or development.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces (issues, PRs, discussions, and other community channels).

## Enforcement

Project maintainers may remove, edit, or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it via the process in `SECURITY.md` (or via GitHub moderation/reporting tools when available).
